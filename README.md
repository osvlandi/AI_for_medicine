## 📚 Course Overview

The specialization is divided into three courses:

1. **AI for Medical Diagnosis**
   - Build a deep learning model to diagnose diseases from medical images.
   - Apply transfer learning and evaluate using metrics like sensitivity and specificity.

2. **AI for Medical Prognosis**
   - Use survival models to predict disease outcomes.
   - Apply Kaplan-Meier estimators and hazard ratios.

3. **AI for Medical Treatment**
   - Estimate treatment effects using machine learning.
   - Learn about causal inference and uplift modeling.

> **Note:** This repository contains only my personal implementations and notes. It does not include any copyrighted material from the course.
